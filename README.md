# Landing Page Dasheen Leaf

Dasheen Leaf is a fictional company that deliver meal kits to their customers. The landing page was built to increase customer conversion and to provide a quick overview of what the company offers. 

## Technologies

Built with HTML, pure CSS and JavaScript to test my knowledge on CSS grid layout, flexbox and creating a responsive navigation bar. As mentioned, CSS grid and flexbox was used to build the layout and to assist in the responsiveness of the webpage, along with media queries. JavaScript was mainly used to toggle the menu icon for mobile screens.
